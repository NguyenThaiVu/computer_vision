# COMPUTER_VISION
## Series about computer vision 
1. deep-learning-face-detection: perform facial recognition using OpenCV, Python, and deep learning.
2. deep-learning-with-opencv: use OpenCV and GoogleLeNet (pre-trained on ImageNet) to classify images.
3. distance between object: measuring distance between objects in an image.
4. liveness-dectection: create a liveness detector spotting fake faces and real faces in face recognition systems.
5. ordering-coordinates: ordering coordinates clockwise with Python and OpenCV.
6. simple-object-tracking: tracking face in video stream.
7. size-of-object: measuring the size of objects in an image.
